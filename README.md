# S.O.L.I.D Principles in Object-Oriented Programming

The S.O.L.I.D principles are a set of design principles in object-oriented programming that help create more understandable, flexible, and maintainable software. Here is a brief overview of each principle:

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- **Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
- **Purpose**: This principle helps to reduce the complexity of a class by ensuring it only focuses on a single task.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- **Definition**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Purpose**: This principle encourages the design of software that can be extended without modifying existing code, thus reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- **Definition**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
- **Purpose**: This principle ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass without causing errors, promoting the use of polymorphism.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- **Definition**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Purpose**: This principle promotes the creation of smaller, more specific interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones, reducing the impact of changes and improving code readability.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
- **Purpose**: This principle aims to reduce the coupling between high-level and low-level modules, making the system more modular and easier to maintain.

These principles collectively help in building robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems.
